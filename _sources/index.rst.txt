AFQ-Browser:
============

visualizing and sharing Automated Fiber Quantification results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This software generates a browser-based visualization of data processed with
the `Automated Fiber Quantification (AFQ) <https://github.com/yeatmanlab/AFQ>`_
software. For `example <https://yeatmanlab.github.io/AFQBrowser-demo/>`_.

Tractography based on diffusion weighted MRI (dMRI) is used to find  the major
white matter fascicles (tracts) in the living human brain. The health of these
tracts is an important factor underlying many cognitive and neurological
disorders. `AFQ` is a software package focused on automated delineation of the
major fiber tracts in individual human brains, and quantification of the
tissue properties within the tracts (`Yeatman et al. 2012 <http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049790>`_).

This software package allows researchers to interactively query the data
processed with `AFQ` (or other similar software) to explore patterns in the
data.
